EXPERTS WARN OF THREAT FROM 100GB BUG

Firebringer News Service (FBNS) - Experts warned today of a new and
deadly threat to our beleaguered civilization: the 100GB Bug.

As most people know, McDonald's restaurant signs show the number of
hamburgers the giant chain has sold. That number now stands at 99
billion burgers, or 99 Gigaburgers (GB).  Within months or even weeks,
that number will roll over to 100GB.  McDonald's signs, however, were
designed years ago, when the prospect of selling one hundred billion
hamburgers seemed unthinkably remote. So the signs have only two
decimal places.

This means that, after the sale of the 100 billionth burger, McDonald's
signs will read "00 Billion Burgers Sold."  This, experts predict, will
convince the public that, in over thirty years, no McDonald's hamburgers
have ever in fact been sold,  causing a complete collapse of consumer
confidence in McDonald's products.

The ensuing catastrophic drop in sales is seen as almost certain to
force the already-troubled company into bankruptcy.  This, in turn,
will push the teetering American economy over the brink,
which, finally, will complete the total devastation of the global
economy, ending civilization as we know it, and forcing us all to live
on beetles.

"The people who know -- the sign-makers -- are really scared of 100GB," one
expert said. "I don't know about you, but I'm digging up a copy of THE
FIELD GUIDE TO NORTH AMERICAN INSECTS and
heading for the hills."

Two Digits for a Date
(to the tune of "Gilligan's Island," more or less)
Author Unknown

Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale
Of the doom that is our fate.
That started when programmers used
Two digits for a date.
Two digits for a date.

Main memory was smaller then;
Hard disks were smaller, too.
"Four digits are extravagant,
So let's get by with two.
So let's get by with two."

"This works through 1999,"
The programmers did say.
"Unless we rewrite before that
It all will go away.
It all will go away."

But Management had not a clue:
"It works fine now, you bet!
A rewrite is a straight expense;
We won't do it just yet.
We won't do it just yet."

Now when 2000 rolls around
It all goes straight to Hell,
For zero's less than ninety-nine,
As anyone can tell.
As anyone can tell.

The mail won't bring your pension check
It won't be sent to you
When you're no longer sixty-eight,
But minus thirty-two.
But minus thirty-two.

The problems we're about to face
Are frightening, for sure.
And reading every line of code's
The only certain cure.
The only certain cure.

[key change, big finish]

There's not much time,
There's too much code.
(And Cobol-coders, few)
When the century is finished with,
We may be finished, too.
We may be finished, too.

Eight thousand years from now I hope
That things weren't left too late,
And people aren't then lamenting
Four digits for a date.
Four digits for a date.
