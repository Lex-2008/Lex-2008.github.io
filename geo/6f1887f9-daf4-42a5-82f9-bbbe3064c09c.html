<p class='intro' style='view-transition-name:intro-6f1887f9-daf4-42a5-82f9-bbbe3064c09c'>A website with a provoking name features funny games</p>
<p>Link: <a href="http://stabyourself.net/mari0/">stabyourself.net</a>.
Due to provocative name this site should be blocked in Russia.</p>
<h1>Mari0</h1>
<p>a.k.a. &quot;<em>Mario with a Portal gun</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>Must-see for fans of either of these two games (Mario and Portal).
Must-play for fans of both of these games!
I'm fan of neither of these games, but still &quot;WOW&quot; on it :)</p>

<h1>Not Tetris 2</h1>
<p>a.k.a. &quot;<em>Real physics tetris</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>Not to be mixed up with <a href="http://xkcd.com/724/">Hell Tetris</a> (yes there are playable versions of this, too).
Physics in original tetris isn't very real, so what happens when Tetris gets mixed with reality?</p>

<h1>Other</h1>
<p><a href="http://stabyourself.net/mari0/">Their website</a> features another (less interesting, to my taste) games, which you still can check out: &quot;Not Pacman&quot; for all Pacman fans (and gravity lovers) and &quot;Ortho Robot&quot; for those who likes solving quests.</p>
