<p>So I was playing this game recently:</p>
<p><img src="world-domination.png" alt="Screenshot of the game" /></p>
<p>Old website is gone, but it looks like <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/105942">here on newgrounds</a> they have a new(er) version of it.</p>
<p>Back than I couldn't select opponents and had 4 of them:
(listed left to right, top to bottom on the screen in top right corner):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vlodimar Pitun</strong></li>
<li><strong>Col. Kodoffi</strong></li>
<li><strong>Osumo Ben Lada</strong></li>
<li><strong>G. W. Bash</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Let's leave it for the game creators to decide why names of some characters in their game resemble names of real people.
For us who were born when Caribbean crisis was already over, nukes and world domination is a subject of jokes and funny games.</p>
<p>And that's how the game rolled:</p>
<ol>
<li>Since the very beginning of the game, <strong>Kodoffi</strong> and <strong>Ben Lada</strong> were shooting rockets at each other,
and we with <strong>mr. Pitun</strong> <em>nuked away</em> <strong>G. W. Bash</strong>.</li>
<li>After that, <strong>Kodoffi</strong> became the weakest guy left alive, and in 3-vs-1 battle he <em>didn't stand a chance</em>.</li>
<li>But all his military efforts were concentrated on his original enemy,
so <strong>Ben Lada</strong> became our next target (for us with <strong>mr. Pitun</strong>).</li>
<li>When <strong>Ben Lada's</strong> <em>fate</em> was <em>becoming obvious</em>, I sent few nukes in the direction of my <em>too strong</em> ally - just to ensure that he'd be <em>weaker then me</em> when we would be left one-on-one.</li>
<li>And after that I got into a long <em>propaganda war</em> with <strong>mr. Pitun</strong>,
because nukes are <em>pretty useless</em> in one-to-one combat.</li>
</ol>
<p>Total time spent: 2 hours.</p>
