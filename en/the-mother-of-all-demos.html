<p><a href="http://thedemo.org">The Mother of All Demos</a> was a result of a research project aimed at
improving human intellect by employing computers and finding "what if you had a
computer at your desk?". Remind you, at that time everyone else was using punch
cards and saw computers as big calculators:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You get in line for your turn to feed your data and instructions into a
computer, and crunch, crunch, crunch, for hours and hours, it would work
those calculations, and come back with results punched out on some 'punch
cards' or 'paper tape' and then the computer would forget you ever asked
because it had hardly any memory or disk space</p>

<p>(Quote from <a href="http://www.dougengelbart.org/kids/justforkids.html">kids page</a> - good tl;dr summary on the subject)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">Wikipedia</a> article on the subject says that this demo showed such concepts
of modern computers as:
windows, hypertext, graphics, efficient navigation and command input, video
conferencing, the computer mouse, word processing, dynamic file linking,
revision control, and a collaborative real-time editor</p>

<p>Wonder how many IT gems we can find in there. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VScVgXM7lQQ&amp;list=PLCGFadV4FqU2yAqCzKaxnKKXgnJBUrKTE">Worth watching</a>?</p>

<p>Date of this article is set to the day when Douglas Engelbart - great visionary,
father of computer mouse and inventor of modern computer interfaces - passed
away. Without you, we wouldn't have not only computer mouse, but the whole
computer interfaces would be much different. God only knows how many IT
engineers were inspired by your ideas.</p>
