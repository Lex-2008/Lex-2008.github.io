One guy has too much of free time :)
He created [asciimation.co.nz][] [(cached version)][asciimation-c] - a website where you can watch a big part of Star Wars episode IV (the first movie) carefully printed as ASCII art animation.

That's pretty impressive by itself,
but especially if you read [FAQ][] [(cached)][FAQ-c]
and think about all the effort gone into making this.
