	<p class="intro">After some time of pondering, I switched to GitHub-Flavoured Markdown (GFM)</p>
<p>Main thing that made me convert was that it's based on <a href="https://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a>,
which claims to be one of the fastest Markdown renderers.
And indeed, in my limited testing, a file which Markdown.pl took 0.1 second to process,
both <code>cmark</code> and <code>cmark-gfm</code> processed in 0.002s - at least 50 times faster!
Also it supports all fancy features that I desired:</p>
<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox" checked="" disabled="" /> tables</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" checked="" disabled="" /> tasklists (like this one)</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" checked="" disabled="" /> <del>strikethrough</del> text</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" checked="" disabled="" /> footnotes<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, there are some features that I actually don't care that much about, so won't even mention them :)</p>
<p>GitHub has a very wordy <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax">introduction</a> into their version of Markdown,
which also covers not only GFM, but also GitHub-specific features,
like <code>@mentions</code>.
Also they have more technically-worded <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">spec</a>, which is based on CommonMark's spec,
thus being also very verbose.
But at least they highlight GFM-specific features in a different color!</p>
<hr />
<p>I only need to be careful when converting old posts into new format.
For example, this markdown source:</p>
<pre><code>    First line
    - second line
    third line
</code></pre>
<p>gets treated differently by Markdown.pl and CommonMark / GFM!
Markdown.pl sees it all as a single paragraph,
while others - as a line and a bullet list, i.e.
like this source:</p>
<pre><code>    First line

    * second line third line
</code></pre>
<p>That's because Markdown.pl requires an empty line before each list item.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<hr />
<p>But it means that I can't just replace call to <code>Markdown.pl</code> with a call to <code>cmark-gfm</code>!
It should be configurable per-file.
But actually it turned out to be pretty easy to achieve:
Lazyblog already has <em>templating</em> which is configured with env variables,
so it's trivial to add a new env variable
(with default value of <code>Markdown.pl</code>),
which can be overwritten by each file before it's processed by a markdown interpreter.
Naturally, it also means that if a file sets this variable
(called <code>PROCESSOR</code>)
to value <code>cat</code> -
then it's <strong>not</strong> processed, and thus can be written in plain HTML!
Nice!</p>

<p>I actually didn't want footnotes <em>that</em> much, but they look nice and might be useful sometimes.
