So again, like [previous time][w2], I went on spree of sending my CV to all barely-relevant positions (mostly QA and DevOps),
barely checking what the company is about.

One company name, however, I recognized,
because about a year before that
we bought my wife a [reMarkable 2 tablet][rM2] -
a nice device with paper-like eInk screen -
for making notes, reading ebooks, and leaving marks in them.
Little did we know back then, that in one year I will be applying for a position there!

<!-- Wow! That would be a good company to work at, - I thought. -->
<!-- Turns out they're a Norwegian company, and located not far from where we live. -->
<!-- Nice! -->

Interesting coincidence: when I was looking for a job [for the first time][w1],
I applied three times in a row to the same company, until they hired me.
This time I coincidentally did almost the same -
applied to three different positions, although at the same time:
QA, DevOps, and C++ (build) engineer.
For the last one I had the least hopes
(it sounded like a position for a C++ programmer,
and what kind of C++ programmer am I?
Last time I was C++ programming back in high school!),
but, against all odds, it was the position where I ended up getting the job.
I'm not even sure if other positions even considered me!

Turns out, this was a position for a C++ **build** engineer,
with focus on _maintaining build system_ -
exactly what I was doing here at CFEngine!
A bit of C++ knowledge was desired,
but on a level enough to parse logs, stacktraces,
and to know what error message to search at Google -
exactly what I was doing here at CFEngine!

The hiring process was pretty close to [described on their website][our-process]:

* first an "introductory" interview about the position,
explaining what is expected from me and what can I expect from the company;

* then a case assignment ("homework") -
I won't spoil the details, but it was more about CI
rather than C++ :-)

* then a "case assignment" interview,
where we discussed my "homework" and
I had a (slightly unexpected) session of "live coding";

* after that, two at the same day:
  - a "social lunch" where I got, in addition to free food,
  a chance to talk to one of my future higher-level managers;

  - and a virtual interview with one of other higher-level managers;

All these steps happened pretty fast: one week I had introductory interview and got a homework assignment, second week I had everything else.
After that it took over a week, however, for reMarkable to come back to me with an offer.

So please keep this in mind if someone applying for a position at reMarkable reads this:
delays might happen!
