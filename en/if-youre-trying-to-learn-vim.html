<br>I totally agree to <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this article</a>:
if you decided to try Vim — <strong>don't</strong> punish yourself for that (by disabling arrow keys and mouse)!
<br>
<br>Instead, take it easy: learn the basics (modes) and start with simple editing. It's XXI century, modern versions of Gvim have pretty nice system integration for a reason — to help you stop "fighting" your new editor. Vim is not about doing things "the
only true way", with minimum keystrokes — it's about doing things efficiently, and if it's easier for you to type <tt>xxx</tt> than <tt>3x</tt> — feel free to do it!
<br>
<br>To start loving Vim, try to find out how it can help you: if you do something with too many keystrokes — it probably can be optimized. If you have colleagues using Vim — ask them what useful tricks they know. If you have free time — read <a
href="http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">articles like this</a> —
there you might find useful Vim tricks you'll love Vim for. Print some cheatsheet (<a href="http://www.viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">like this one</a>)
and look through Vim help — for same reason. If you want to do something, but don't know how — ask Google — chances are high there's a built-in feature or plugin for that.
<br>
<br>And one day, in some other editor, you will feel uncomfortable and will want to get back to Vim.
<br>
<br>For me such "killer feature" was <tt>ci"</tt> to <tt>c</tt>hange text <tt>i</tt>nside <tt>"</tt>quotes". Later I started using <tt>f</tt> and <tt>t</tt> to <tt>f</tt>ind and get <tt>t</tt>o specific symbols on current line and understood benefits of multiple registers
(clipboards) and <a href="http://my.opera.com/alex-shpak/blog/2013/01/09/macro-to-excange-two-values-in-vim" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">macro recording</a>.
