It was quite old ([archive.org][arc-first] suggests it's been there since 2008), but interesting piece of information.

Note that it ceased to exist at the end of 2015, but its latest version is still available via [archive.org][arc-last] and [archive.is][is].

It's thanks to this list I learned about such games as
Nexuiz,
World of Padman,
Torus Trooper,
Bontago,
Scorched3D,
and learned that Grand Theft Auto 2 was available for free download for some time (it's not available at the moment of writing)

So if you're bored (and have Windows), there's a whole list of entertainment waiting for you!
