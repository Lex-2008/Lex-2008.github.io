<p>Apparently, it's possible to style RSS feed to look nicer than a raw XML when opened in a browser.
To do so, you need to use a thing called XSLT - eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation.
Basically, it's an XML document which explains how to transform one document (usually XML) into another one - for example, HTML.</p>
<p>W3schools has a simple <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xsl_transformation.asp">example</a> of transforming an XML (in that example, some CD disc database) to an HTML.
Another simple example is <a href="https://github.com/genmon/aboutfeeds/blob/main/tools/pretty-feed-v3.xsl">this</a> XSLT stylesheet for RSS 2.0 from author of aboutfeeds.com,
which I saw used on more than one website.</p>
<p>But wait a second: RSS feed is a list of posts, with short summaries and links to original pages,
but main page of my blog is <em>also</em> a list of posts with short summaries and links to original pages...
So can't beautified RSS feed serve as main page of my blog, too?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE that</strong> here I use term &quot;RSS&quot; in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I say &quot;RSS feed&quot;, I'm talking about a general idea of website posting updates in a standardized, computer-readable format, <em>no matter what</em> exact format.</li>
<li>When I say &quot;RSS 2.0&quot;, I'm talking about the <a href="https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification">specific format</a> in which these updates are posted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably that's because I remember when RSS <a href="https://press.opera.com/2004/05/12/the-most-innovative-browser-opera-7-50-released-everything-you-need-online/">first appeared</a> in my browser,
and since then the term got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_trademark">genericized</a> in my mind
and started meaning not the specific technology but a general idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And after looking through <a href="https://darekkay.com/assets/xsl/rss-style.xsl">some</a> of more <a href="https://chrismorgan.info/atom.xsl" title="search for `00:00:00` in this one, for some XSLT fun">complex</a> examples
and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26167248#26169162">Hacker News comments</a>,
IÂ decided to go with Atom feed format instead of RSS 2.0,
primarily for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>it has a nicer format of dates, which is close to what I already use,</li>
<li>it has a place for extra feed links, where I can put my &quot;you may also like my&quot; links,</li>
</ul>
<p>and also because of the above comment mentioning that Atom is better specified
and has a place to put (X)HTML into it, while RSS 2.0 is relying on feed reader's interpretation.
So I loaded up <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4287">Atom spec</a> in one tab,
Mozilla's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT">XSLT reference</a> in another, and started hacking.</p>
<p>I thought it will take me two hours.
But it actually took me not two, but three.
And not hours, but days!<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>  ðŸ˜…</p>
<p>Also worth noting that XSLT has some features that make some Javascript parts of lazyblog redundant.
Like, you probably would expect XSLT to have <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT/Element/for-each"><code>&lt;xsl:for-each&gt;</code></a> tag
to walk through all child elements of some element.
But it also has <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT/Element/sort"><code>&lt;xsl:sort&gt;</code></a> tag (w3schools has a nice <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xsl_sort.asp">example</a> for it),
which makes Javascript-powered sorting redundant.
Together with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT/Element/if"><code>&lt;xsl:if&gt;</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT/Element/choose"><code>&lt;xsl:choose&gt;</code></a>,
and with a bunch of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath/Functions">functions for string manupulation</a>,
this can replace filtering and maybe even search...
If only browsers had a feature to pass query parameters to XSLT templates!
Then I could probably use XSLT for everything and stop using javascript entirely.
But oh well, looks like browser support for XSLT is indeed limited to being &quot;static&quot;
and simply processing server responses,
while dynamic parts require Javascript or server-side scripting...
But where's fun in that?</p>
<p>And here's the result - visually it's totally indistinguishable from the <a href="my-blog-is-also-rss-feed.htm">previous version</a><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>!
Apart from the &quot;Last update&quot; timestamp in top-right corner...
That's because Atom feed spec <strong>requires</strong> feed to include an &quot;updated&quot; timestamp
(presumably for readers to stop processsing a feed if it didn't change),
so I had to add the feature of updating the last built timestamp to lazyblog...
But then, why not show it in HTML, too?
It adds a bit of anxiety, though:
now I know that I can't do some change quietly,
hoping that none will notice it -
this timestamp will tell everyone that <em>something</em> changed there recently...
And for those who check my blog regularly
(let's pretend there are people like this):
they will also see it as &quot;<em>something</em> changed since your last visit&quot;,
but might not see what exactly, and left wondering what they missed...
The only people who <em>might</em> benefit from it are those who
use actual RSS feed reader programs, because these programs might highlight the modified entries to them.</p>
<p>The only thing that I don't like is that in <a href="https://github.com/Lex-2008/lazyblog/blob/0f6bda9092222b121cf09efe99fccfba5bf78677/.index-template.html">previous version</a>,
index template page was a 70-lines file, almost completely &quot;plain HTML&quot;, with just some <code>$template_placeholders</code>,
while in new version this HTML is smeared among 300 lines of XML...
But oh well, what can we do?
XSLT also supports <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath/Functions/document"><code>document()</code></a> function to load and parse an external document,
which I already use to support different languages,
so maybe I could use <strong>that</strong> to load one more file -an XHTML template,
and then XSLT &quot;program&quot; will simply fill placeholders inside it?..
Too bad there are no built-in template manipulation functions in XSLT.
Even Linux command line <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/envsubst.1.html">has it</a>!
Although since 2003, according to Copyright note in the above page,
while XSLT 1.0 (the latest version supported by web browsers),
according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-10/">this page</a>,
was finalized in 1999,
so someone might argue that XSLT <em>predates</em> <code>envvsubst</code>, and my argument is wrong,
but come on! XSLT is <em>itself</em> a templating language!</p>
<p>Would I recommend anyone to do the same?
Not sure :-)
I would advice you to read through <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36401854#36403649">this comment</a> first
(note the comment is from 2023,
and author of that comment also created a XSL stylesheet which I linked before -
it is both bigger and more advanced than mine,
so his opinion on this subject should be worth listening even more than mine),
and then I can confirm that in 2024 I've seen it all, too:
Firefox tab freezing if Dev Tools are open,
Chrome being more &quot;picky&quot; (or, rather, strict) about XSLT errors and printing them to terminal<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>,
but also Chrome inserting two <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> elements when asked for one and
having serious performance issues once, until restarted<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>And yes, debugging indeed feels like back in early 2000s:
<code>printf</code> debugging, whole page being blank in case of a single mistake <em>somewhere</em>...
So quite often I ended up deleting chunks of XSLT stylesheet
using binary search to find where the error was.</p>
<p>Also, turns out, I'm not <a href="https://curiosity-driven.org/">the first one</a> to have RSS feed as the main page!</p>
<section class="footnotes">
<ol>
<li id="fn1">
<p>and then more than a whole day to write this blog post <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">â†©</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn2">
<p>previous version preserved here just for reference, won't be updated in a future. <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">â†©</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn3">
<p>Actually, because of this, I found it easier to test using Chrome during development,
because &quot;what works in Chrome will likely work in Firefox, too&quot;
(but not always the other way around), but also
because unlike Firefox, Chrome printed these errors <em>at least somewhere</em>!
Although I must admit I didn't try starting Firefox from terminal. <a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-backref">â†©</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn4">
<p>Chrome performance issues might be related to the fact that
just before that I changed screen scaling back from 125% to 100%
in display settings, while running under Wayland.
Firefox picked up the change instantly, while Chrome was still at 125% scale until restart,
so something is definitely different between them. <a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-backref">â†©</a></p>
