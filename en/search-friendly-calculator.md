If your favourite search engine lacks a built-in calculator capability,
and you would like them to have it -
just ask them to index `calc.shpakovsky.ru` website.
It's available both in [plaintext HTTP][pt] mode for those who
prefer speed over security,
and in [secure HTTPS][sc] mode for those who
prefer otherwise.

[pt]: http://calc.shpakovsky.ru/
[sc]: https://calc.shpakovsky.ru/

It has pages for every combination of any two numbers and 4 basic mathematic operations,
with cross-links for easy search engine discoverability.
And yes, before you ask - it indeed has a page for [292091397-275633124][m].

[m]: http://calc.shpakovsky.ru/292091397m275633124.html

While yes, of course these pages are generated dynamically on request,
they should look static and be search engine-friendly.
