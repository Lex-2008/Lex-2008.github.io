If your favourite search engine lacks a built-in calculator capability,
and you would like them to have it -
just ask them to index [this site][calc].

[calc]: http://calc.shpakovsky.ru/

It has pages for every combination of two numbers and any of 4 mathematic operations,
all linked to each other!
And yes, before you ask - it indeed has a page for [292091397-275633124][m].

[m]: http://calc.shpakovsky.ru/292091397m275633124.html

While yes, of course these pages are generated dynamically on request,
they should look static and be search engine-friendly.
