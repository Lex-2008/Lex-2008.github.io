Interesting article which draws our attention to the fact that modern computers react to keyboard input slower than old ones
(i.e. it takes more time from you hit a key and before it appears on the screen).

Main reason is that there are many more levels of abstraction between keyboard, text editor (which also became more complex), and screen - imagine OS, device drivers, multiple concurrently running applications / windows, etc - and many of this running asynchronously.
