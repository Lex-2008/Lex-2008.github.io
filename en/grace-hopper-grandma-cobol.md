9th of September is considered to be the "<abbr title="Quality Assurance
Engineer, i.e. Tester">QA</abbr> day" in Russia.  Why? Because of this
anecdotical story mentined in [jargon file][] featuring Grace Hopper.

But if you read [Wikipedia article][] about her, you will learn that she is
famous not only for this (note that it wasn't actually her who found the bug,
she is just known for telling this story), but actually she had quite some
ground-breaking ideas, including, for example, idea of _compilers_. Just try to
imagine it:

> It's not people, but computer programs who should create computer programs.

Sounds good even now, heh?

So she is one of authors and promoters of [COBOL][] programming language,
which became quite popular back in 60s and is still used in old systems today.

Worth noting that many think that computer issues are called "bugs" _because_ of Grace Hopper's above quote.
This is not correct - as the [computersworld][][(cached version)](http://archive.is/e9rFH) article explains,
this term was used as early as by Thomas Edison!

Update: a longer article at [The Lunduke Journal of Technology][lunduke][(cached version)](https://archive.ph/W6otP)
explains that it was even before that! You can also check what [Hacker News][hn] comments say about that.
