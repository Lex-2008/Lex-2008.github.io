I once really, genuinely, tried to believe that the Earth is flat (round).
But failed because my eyes told me that the Sun goes _down_ while according to _official_ [Flat Earth Society][fes] point of view, Sun never gets below Earth disk.

Yes, you might be surprised, but there is such a thing - a community of people who believe or claim to believe that the Earth is flat.
They have a [website][fes], with live forum, articles and stuff.

I won't discuss if I think that they genuinely believe in it or if they do it "just for fun", but I want to tell you that I find it impressive that in modern world (since the website is in English, I assume that most members of this society are from US), there still are people who are _not afraid_ to think _against_ something what is "common sense" by definition of majority.
After all, when we first heard about Quantum Theory, wasn't our first reaction "What a nonsense!"?

Once again, link to the official website: [Flat Earth Society][fes]
