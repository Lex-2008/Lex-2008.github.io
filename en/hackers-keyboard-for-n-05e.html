			<p class="intro">Compatibility patch</p>
			<p>Hacker's Keyboard is a software keyboard for Android, featuring a full 5-row keyboard with arrows, Tab, Esc, Ctrl keys.
Also it has a "normal" 4-row keyboard layout, and you can easily switch between them.</p>

<p>Usually, phone users enable 5-row keyboard in landscape mode,
and 4-row one in portrait mode;
while on a tablet you can set it to always use 5-row keyboard.</p>

<p>Recently I <a href="http://www.kyoex.com/docomo-nec-n-05e-medias-w-dual-screen-smartphone-unlocked/">acquired</a> a nice <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/21/3902140/nec-medias-w-hands-on">NEC Medias W N-05e</a> phone with a unique 2-screen design.
Thanks to this, it's kind of a 2-in-1 device: it can function both as a 4" phone, and as a 5.42" tablet.
And in phone-portrait mode, I expect it to show me a 4-row keyboard,
while in tablet-portrait mode - a 5-row one.
In other words, keyboard size should actually depend not on phone orientation, but on screen width
(actually, it's more logical if you think about it for a bit).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this keyboard didn't offer such feature out-of-the-box,
but luckily it's an <a href="https://ctrl.blog/entry/choose-linux">open source software</a>, so I could <a href="https://github.com/Lex-2008/hackerskeyboard/commit/ff30ef678ebc0a23a66c315e3abb14cf7c7faa78">easily modify</a> it!</p>

<p>And the compiled *.apk file is <a href="hackers-keyboard-for-n-05e.apk">here</a>.</p>

<p>Note that as long as there are no <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/02/asus_launches_5in_1_androidwindows_phonelaptoptablet/">other</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXBdT4tfwdo">similar</a> <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3519786/Samsung-s-foldable-phone-double-tablet-Radical-gadget-set-release-2017.html">devices</a> which can function as both phone and a tablet,
I assume that I'm the only one who needs such keyboard, and release it in "works for me" state:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>there is no configuration regarding the "landscape" and "portrait" screen width</p></li>
<li><p>dictionaries probably don't work</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If there are other users of Hacker's keyboard who need this patch - please write me (email at the bottom of this page)
- I'll be more then happy to learn what kind of device you have!
And maybe will consider to improve it.</p>
