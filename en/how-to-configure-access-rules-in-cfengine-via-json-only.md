CFEngine promises language is rather unique and very powerful.

In his [latest article][l] my colleague Nick Anderson shows how to write a policy after which you can define all your access rules in def.json, thus avoiding need to write policy. Good for both worlds: for those who *likes* CFEngine policy language it clearly shows how powerful it is; for those who doesn't - it gives a small magic policy snippet which lets you avoid writing policy.

Also, I highly recommend everyone interested (or using) CFEngine to periodically check for new posts in [Nick's blog][b]!
