			<p class="intro">Today I've accompanied my old friend on his last journey.</p>
			<p>Good bye, old friend, you've served me well.
Together we've been to <a href="/photos/15-10-17-autumn-in-forest.html">places I couldn't reach alone</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the time you were carrying me,
but sometimes I had to walk with you.</p>

<p>We've met <a href="/photos/12-03-bike.html">four years ago</a>,
and you've never betrayed me since then -
even when some part of you broke -
it always was in most convenient time and place,
and never - in the middle of the forest late in the evening.</p>

<p>Oh well, old friend, now your journey continues without me -
after your metal parts get recycled, you'll turn up in something else.</p>

<p>In a car, or maybe in a plane.
You've always wanted to fly, we know it!</p>

<hr />

<p>Anyway, old bike is dead long live new bike!
