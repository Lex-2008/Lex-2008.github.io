You've built a company. Twice. Apple computers were always known for being the most user-friendly. Others copied and followed.

Before you created iPhone, _smartphones_ together with _communicators_ were considered "_geeky_" devices, which only nerds and CEOs would use.
Now my mom has a smartphone, too.

Without you world would not be the same - computer interfaces would be more complex, less people would use them, and IT guys would be less respected.

Also, your [presentations][] [(archived copy)](http://archive.is/ICyZw) were great!
