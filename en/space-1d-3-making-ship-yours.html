	<p class="intro">The game is playable now!</p>
<p>My original plan to make a game which <a href="space-1d-0-idea.html">will be more fun to make than to play</a> failed: the game feels rather fun.</p>

<p>Now it has <em>starbases</em>, which give you <em>missions</em> to deliver some cargo to a next starbase.
Upon delivery, you receive a nice reward:
either number of guns and fuel equal to number of <em>boxes</em> you deliver;
or a single random component to extend your ship, if you delivered <strong>all</strong> cargo you were asked.
Note that it's not a big deal if if you fail the mission (lose cargo) - the base will forgive you and give a new mission.</p>

<p>Another visible addition is space <em>docks</em>, which allow you to reorder ship components, and together with aggressive auto-save trying to make the ship <em>feel like yours</em>.</p>

<p>Also, AI became smarter and attacks player only if it has more guns.</p>

<p>To help progressing faster, most of questions have an answer marked as default.
This way, just by repeatedly hitting the <code>&lt;space&gt;</code> key on your keyboard (pun intended), you can progress faster.</p>
