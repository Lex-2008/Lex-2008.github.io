Good bye, old friend, you've served me well.
Together we've been to [places I couldn't reach alone][forest].

Most of the time you were carrying me,
but sometimes I had to walk with you.

We've met [four years ago][bike],
and you've never betrayed me since then -
even when some part of you broke -
it always was in most convenient time and place,
and never - in the middle of the forest late in the evening.

Oh well, old friend, now your journey continues without me -
after your metal parts get recycled, you'll turn up in something else.

In a car, or maybe in a plane.
You've always wanted to fly, we know it!

Anyway, old bike is dead long live new bike!
[This one][xxl]. [(archive.is link |][a1][ the other one)][a2] Note: I've bought it for a price somewhere between these two.
