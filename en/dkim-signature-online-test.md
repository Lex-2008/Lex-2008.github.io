There's an easy online tool for that now!

Well, as long as pasting text into a webform is easier for you than into a locally installed `opendkim-testmsg` CLI tool.

Just navigate to [opendkim-testmsg.shpakovsky.ru][l] and play with your message.
Possible uses include restoring messages mangled by mailing lists into their "original" state.

Let me know if you find any use for it :)
