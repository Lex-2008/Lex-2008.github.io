There is a game I want to create.
Idea is heavily borrowed from [Rodina][] game
(Nice game for those having background in Slavic languages ;-) ).

[Rodina]: https://elliptic-games.com/

And that's what I want to create:
a game about space, where you can:

* control both player and a spaceship
* control them at the same time
* look outside of the spaceship while being inside it
* walking inside ship
* walking on the ship surface
* free fly (outside of the ship)
* other ships
* ship-to-ship combat
* combat onboard the ship
* combat on the ship surface
* maybe even landing on planets

Of course, this game will be more fun to create then to play,
but I don't expect anyone else to play it :)

As a 0-th step, I plan to base it on babylon.js and start with this babylon.js demo:
