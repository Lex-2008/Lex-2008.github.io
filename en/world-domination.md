So I was playing this game recently:

![Screenshot of the game](world-domination.png)

Old website is gone, but it looks like [here on newgrounds][ng] they have a new(er) version of it.

[ng]: https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/105942

Back than I couldn't select opponents and had 4 of them:
(listed left to right, top to bottom on the screen in top right corner):

* **Vlodimar Pitun**
* **Col. Kodoffi**
* **Osumo Ben Lada**
* **G. W. Bash**

Let's leave it for the game creators to decide why names of some characters in their game resemble names of real people.
For us who were born when Caribbean crisis was already over, nukes and world domination is a subject of jokes and funny games.

And that's how the game rolled:

1. Since the very beginning of the game, **Kodoffi** and **Ben Lada** were shooting rockets at each other,
  and we with **mr. Pitun** _nuked away_ **G. W. Bash**.
2. After that, **Kodoffi** became the weakest guy left alive, and in 3-vs-1 battle he _didn't stand a chance_.
3. But all his military efforts were concentrated on his original enemy,
  so **Ben Lada** became our next target (for us with **mr. Pitun**).
4. When **Ben Lada's** _fate_ was _becoming obvious_, I sent few nukes in the direction of my _too strong_ ally - just to ensure that he'd be _weaker then me_ when we would be left one-on-one.
5. And after that I got into a long _propaganda war_ with **mr. Pitun**,
  because nukes are _pretty useless_ in one-to-one combat.

Total time spent: 2 hours.
