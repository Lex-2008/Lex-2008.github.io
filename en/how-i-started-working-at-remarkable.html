	<p class="intro">Due to reorganisation at my previous place of work, several people were offered to leave, including me.</p>
<p>So again, like <a href="how-i-started-working-at-cfengine.html">previous time</a>, I went on spree of sending my CV to all barely-relevant positions (mostly QA and DevOps),
barely checking what the company is about.</p>
<p>One company name, however, I recognized,
because about a year before that
we bought my wife a <a href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2">reMarkable 2 tablet</a> -
a nice device with paper-like eInk screen -
for making notes, reading ebooks, and leaving marks in them.
Little did we know back then, that in one year I will be applying for a position there!</p>
<!-- Wow! That would be a good company to work at, - I thought. -->
<!-- Turns out they're a Norwegian company, and located not far from where we live. -->
<!-- Nice! -->
<p>Interesting coincidence: when I was looking for a job <a href="how-i-started-working-for-opera-software.html">for the first time</a>,
I applied three times in a row to the same company, until they hired me.
This time I coincidentally did almost the same -
applied to three different positions, although at the same time:
QA, DevOps, and C++ (build) engineer.
For the last one I had the least hopes
(it sounded like a position for a C++ programmer,
and what kind of C++ programmer am I?
Last time I was C++ programming back in high school!),
but, against all odds, it was the position where I ended up getting the job.
I'm not even sure if other positions even considered me!</p>
<p>Turns out, this was a position for a C++ <strong>build</strong> engineer,
with focus on <em>maintaining build system</em> -
exactly what I was doing here at CFEngine!
A bit of C++ knowledge was desired,
but on a level enough to parse logs, stacktraces,
and to know what error message to search at Google -
exactly what I was doing here at CFEngine!</p>
<hr />
<p>The hiring process was pretty close to <a href="https://careers.remarkable.com/our-process">described on their website</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>first an &quot;introductory&quot; interview about the position,
explaining what is expected from me and what can I expect from the company;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>then a case assignment (&quot;homework&quot;) -
I won't spoil the details, but it was more about CI
rather than C++ :-)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>then a &quot;case assignment&quot; interview,
where we discussed my &quot;homework&quot; and
I had a (slightly unexpected) session of &quot;live coding&quot;;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>after that, two at the same day:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a &quot;social lunch&quot; where I got, in addition to free food,
a chance to talk to one of my future higher-level managers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and a virtual interview with one of other higher-level managers;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All these steps happened pretty fast: one week I had introductory interview and got a homework assignment, second week I had everything else.
After that it took over a week, however, for reMarkable to come back to me with an offer.</p>
<p>So please keep this in mind if someone applying for a position at reMarkable reads this:
delays might happen!</p>
