Until [Jan 2023][eol], Microsoft offered free virtual machines for testing your websites (and maybe software?)
for compatibility with variuos versions of IE and Windows versions.

These VMs were time-limited to 90 days, so not suitable for everyday use.
But if you regret not preserving a backup copy for yourself -
archive.org got you covered!

----

Also note that since at least [April 2016][vm], Microsoft offers a Windows development environment VM. Note, however, that since Oct 2016 they have a built-in expiration date, so as of writing (July 2014) you'll have to re-download them once every two months.

And as mentioned [here][vga], remember to disable 3D Acceleration.
You might also want to enable bidirectional clipboard and drag-and-drop, and increase RAM and CPU limit to something more generous (16 for each, maybe?) before creating first snapshot (add an expiration date to its name, for visibility).
