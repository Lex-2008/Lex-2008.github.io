About four months ago I became an owner of a fanless [Shuttle XS35GT V2](http://global.shuttle.com/main/productsDetail?productId=1488) [(archived |](http://archive.is/LuCIT)[ specs)](http://archive.is/QEoQa) slim PC/HTPC, which opened a new world of fanless computers for me. And, I must admit, it _sounds_ awesome!

Although, indeed, you have to sacrifice some performance, so no super-modern games, but old ones are probably okay.

Apparently, I'm not the only one who enjoys silent computing, and there is a website dedicated to fanless computers - [FanlessTech](http://www.fanlesstech.com)

Also I noticed that all Shuttle computers share similar design.
