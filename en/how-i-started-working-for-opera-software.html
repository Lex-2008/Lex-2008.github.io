<p>The first idea of working for Opera Software came into my mind after watching the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rarTKLmfN4o">famous YouTube video</a><a href="../cache/how-i-started-working-for-opera-software.mp4">(local copy)</a> and looking through the <a href="http://www.opera.com/company/jobs/list/">list of current job openings</a> on Opera website in the beginning of summer of 2010. Hmm, I noticed, that I mostly match requirements for some of engineering jobs! :)</p>
<p>And at the August of the same year I submitted my first resume to Opera Software. And it was quite swiftly rejected. My second attempt - in the beginning of 2011 - was also rejected. It was only after my third attempt, made in the May of 2011, when I received something looking like a positive feedback - a written test to answer.</p>
<p>I can't tell you what the test was about, I'll just say that I had fun answering some of its questions and submitted reply the same week.</p>
<p>After that was a time for a phone interview (it happened via Skype, actually). I talked to Olli and Huib - Desktop Team managers. At first I was asked several questions about Opera users community, then I was faced with some technical (pretty basic) and personal (strengths/weaknesses) questions, and was asked to ask any questions. It all took exactly 45 minutes, and was a very enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>Quite soon after that I was invited to an interview at St. Petersburg Opera office by Johan Borg. There I also met Ilya Shpankov - Russian Community outreach manager. From the start I was given an opportunity to make a 1-hour long speech on <em>&quot;how good am I and why you should hire me&quot;</em>, and after that we discussed some problems of Russian Opera users community. After this interview I was even more cheerful than after previous one: I hardly could hold myself from jumping in the air!</p>
<p>After both interviews I wrote a single thank-you letter, describing how much I enjoyed both of them and concluding why I believe that I will fit in the desired position.</p>
<p>Soon after that I was invited to the Oslo Opera office, where a final interview took place. It was my first trip to Norway, so after the interview I spent several hours walking around the city and taking <a href="/photos/11-08-oslo.html">some photos</a> (Note that I tried <strong>not</strong> to make &quot;street view&quot; photos, because they are already presented on <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3ebte3j">Google Maps</a>). At the interview itself I talked to the same managers who interviewed me via Skype, Karl Anders Ã˜ygard (the head of the whole desktop team) and HÃ¥vard, who tries to improve communication between Opera developers and English-speaking users - same thing I'm going to do for Russian-speaking users. We discussed problems of prioritizing bugs, opening bug tracking system, and others. At the end I had a chat with Kripanjali, HR manager - we talked about the weather differences in India, Oslo and St. Petersburg, different benefits of living in Norway and working for Opera. I got a feeling that she tries to change my mindset from &quot;it's the job, not the salary that interests me&quot; :)</p>
<p>About a week after the interview I received a long-waited email with a job offer to work for Opera Software. Hooray, my 90-days-long quest is finally over, and my more-then-one-year-old dream finally come true!</p>
