Thanks to the power of modern computers, we can run old-good DOS games directly inside a modern web browser!

There are numerous websites for that.
First of them is [js-dos.com][] featuring such games as
"Prince of Persia",
"Alley cat",
"Dangerous Dave 2",
"Pacman",
and even Doom and Doom 2!
in a nice DOS-like interface.

Another website is [archive.org][], which tries to do the same with more "scientific" approach, and has much more games (most of which I don't know) although I haven't looked into it yet.

And what are your favourite childhood games?
Feel free to write me an email (address at the bottom of the page) - your response, if you like, will appear below here!

Comment from [Anastasia Bengtsson](http://anastasia.bengtssons.info):
> Cool, I'll check it out later. Don't you like DOSBox? I've enjoyed playing
Prehistoric, the Legend of Kyrandia: Hand of Fate, The Settlers and one more game - a strategy that reminds me a bit of AOE, there were giants, Valkyries, wizards. It was really good, too bad I forgot the name.

My reply:
> Yes, it's [DOSBox ported to javascript](https://github.com/dreamlayers/em-dosbox/) and running in a browser.
> 
> Regarding old games - no, I play new games sometimes, too: I played Fallout 3 soon after it was released - I completed it in 3 days - it was quite happy time in my life.
> But old games, on contrary, I can't complete that fast.
> 
> And now I'm waiting for GTA V to be released on PC, since I enjoyed playing GTA 2 and 3.
> I also will need to buy a new PC for that, since last time I upgraded it just enough to play Morrowind. :-)
