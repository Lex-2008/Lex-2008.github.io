<p>If you, like me, care about your resilience of your browser session
(history, bookmarks, open tabs),
then you likely do backup it.
Maybe even every 5 minutes?</p>

<p>However, you might also notice that it takes up quite some space.
For example, my Google Chrome "User Data/Default" directory takes up just a bit over a gigabyte.
That's quite a lot to backup every 5 minutes!
But most of this data is not interesting: some caches, extensions which can be reinstalled if needed, and other "site data" which I don't care about.
Actually, most of <em>directories</em> can be safely ignored
(just disable "recursive" option in your backup utility),
what leaves "only" a bit over 150 Mb.
The only subdirectory I actually care about is "Sessions" -
that's where list of all open tabs is saved -
and it can be dealt with by a separate job in the backup utility.</p>

<p>Is it possible to go below 150Mb?
Yes, and that's what this article is about!
Turns out, many of these files are actually SQLite3 databases, which:</p>

<p>a) seem to <em>only</em> grow in size (if you don't <code>VACUUM</code> them)</p>

<p>b) aren't compressed (well, SQLite does support some compression extensions:
one of them is developed by SQLite devs and is <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/zipvfs/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki">paid</a>,
and another one was recently <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32303762">shown</a> on Hacker News,
but could you convince your browser vendor to use any of them?)</p>

<p>c) are optimized for performance (hi indexes), so have some duplicate data.</p>

<p>After manually trying various approaches to compress some of the biggest databases in profile,
(including running <code>VACUUM</code> on a database followed by <code>gzip</code>'ing it),
I concluded that the most simple and space-efficient way is
to <strong>dump</strong> database to a plaintext SQL file,
and then gzip-compress the resulting text,
something like this:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite3 "$file" .dump | gzip &gt;"$file.sql.gz"
</code></pre>

<p>This needs to be done only with SQLite databases,
and care should be taken with exclusively locked files which can't be open for reading
(if your OS supports that).
For example, on Windows I use <a href="https://freefilesync.org/manual.php?topic=volume-shadow-copy">FreeFileSync</a>
to sync browser profiles into <code>C:\browser-backups\%BrowserName%.tmp</code> folders,
and then the following Cygwin script to move-compress them to <code>C:\browser-backups\%BrowserName%</code>,
from where they're picked up by <code>rsync</code> from the backup server.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
cd /cygdrive/c/browser-backups/
for browser in Chrome Vivaldi Firefox; do
    mkdir $browser.wip
    ls $browser.tmp | while IFS= read -r file; do
        if ! head -c15 "$browser.tmp/$file" | fgrep -q "SQLite format 3"; then
            # plain file
            ln "$browser.tmp/$file" $browser.wip
        else
            # sqlite db
            sqlite3 "$browser.tmp/$file" .dump | gzip &gt;"$browser.wip/$file.sql.gz"
            touch -r "$browser.tmp/$file" "$browser.wip/$file.sql.gz"
        fi
    done
    test -d $browser/Sessions &amp;&amp; mv $browser/Sessions $browser.wip
    mv $browser $browser.del
    mv $browser.wip $browser
    rm -rf $browser.del
done
</code></pre>

<p>Note that it also preserves <code>C:\browser-backups\%BrowserName%\Sessions</code> directories for Chrome-based browsers,
assuming they're copied separately.</p>

<p>After that, size of overall data to backup decreased from over 150 Mb to 18Mb,
and the biggest file
(which is also the one which gets changed most often) -
from 64 to 6.6Mb.</p>

<p>While these megabytes might sound not that much,
worth noting that being backed up every 5 minutes,
these backups of browser profiles contribute to a noticeable share of my backup server disk usage.</p>

<p>Of course, alternative would be to use an advanced filesystem,
like ZFS or btrfs,
which natively supports per-block deduplication
(so they can store common parts only once).
But if your backup server is a small router
(or even an entry-level NAS)
without support for these fancy filesystems,
and you can't recompile kernel for it -
what other options do you have?</p>
