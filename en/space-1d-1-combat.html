	<p class="intro">Adding some action to the simple game prototype.</p>
<p>Moving on with the <a href="space-1d-0-idea.html">game I talked previously</a> about, let's add some simple combat.
On the screen below you see your ship, your opponent, and a single action button.</p>

<p>When you click it - ships exchange rockets - number of rockets fired is calculated as minimum of number of rockets and number of guns on the ship, and is subtracted from number of rockets in cargo.</p>

<p>Then ships try to perform evasive maneuvers - their <em>amount</em> is calculated as minimum of number of engine on the ship and number of fuel that it has (fuel is subtracted from cargo - same as with rockets).</p>

<p><em>Efficiency</em> of evasive maneuvers is calculated as ratio of their amount to total number of components.
For example, a ship consisting of 5 components, 2 of which are engines, having enough fuel (at least two), will have only <code>(5-2)/5=60%</code> chance of being hit.</p>

<p>Rockets that reach the ship deal a damage - one component gets destroyed by each rocket, starting from the tail (bottom of the list).
Try imagining how result would look <strong>before</strong> hitting "attack" button! ;)</p>

<p>Next step is to add more options beyond "attack" one (surrender, etc), and let opponent ships replace each other.</p>
