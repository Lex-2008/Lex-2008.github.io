<p>The game is getting harder now.
When seeing a ship from a distance, instead of just two "approach" and "ignore" buttons,
now we have three: "approach aggressively", "approach peacefully", and "avoid contact",
latter being a better phrased "ignore".</p>

<p>Aggressive approach doesn't require shooting, unlike actual attack - so you can actually <em>bluff</em> -
aggressively approach a stronger opponent being covered in cloaks
and see if they get scared (in curent version, AI doesn't have emotions and calmly assesses the situation based on what they can see).</p>

<p>Another option is a peaceful approach (implying trade interest).
In that case AI checks what cargo they would like to have and suggests an exchange
(it wants to have same ratio of rockets/fuel as guns/engines).
You can accept their offer completely or partially.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to have few more types of cargo, but I'm not sure which.</p>
