			<p class="intro">How much can you tease your brain?</p>
			<p>I once really, genuinely, tried to believe that the Earth is flat (round).
But failed because my eyes told me that the Sun goes <em>down</em> while according to <em>official</em> <a href="http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/">Flat Earth Society</a> point of view, Sun never gets below Earth disk.</p>

<p>Yes, you might be surprised, but there is such a thing - a community of people who believe or claim to believe that the Earth is flat.
They have a <a href="http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/">website</a>, with live forum, articles and stuff.</p>

<p>I won't discuss if I think that they genuinely believe in it or if they do it "just for fun", but I want to tell you that I find it impressive that in modern world (since the website is in English, I assume that most members of this society are from US), there still are people who are <em>not afraid</em> to think <em>against</em> something what is "common sense" by definition of majority.
After all, when we first heard about Quantum Theory, wasn't our first reaction "What a nonsense!"?</p>

<p>Once again, link to the official website: <a href="http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/">Flat Earth Society</a></p>
