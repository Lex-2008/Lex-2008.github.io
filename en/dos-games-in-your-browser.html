			<p>Thanks to the power of modern computers, we can run old-good DOS games directly inside a modern web browser!</p>

<p>There are numerous websites for that.
First of them is <a href="http://js-dos.com/">js-dos.com</a> featuring such games as
"Prince of Persia",
"Alley cat",
"Dangerous Dave 2",
"Pacman",
and even Doom and Doom 2!
in a nice DOS-like interface.</p>

<p>Another website is <a href="https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_msdos_games/v2">archive.org</a>, which tries to do the same with more "scientific" approach, and has much more games (most of which I don't know) although I haven't looked into it yet.</p>

<p>And what are your favourite childhood games?
Feel free to write me an email (address at the bottom of the page) - your response, if you like, will appear below here!</p>

<p>Comment from <a href="http://anastasia.bengtssons.info">Anastasia Bengtsson</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cool, I'll check it out later. Don't you like DOSBox? I've enjoyed playing
Prehistoric, the Legend of Kyrandia: Hand of Fate, The Settlers and one more game - a strategy that reminds me a bit of AOE, there were giants, Valkyries, wizards. It was really good, too bad I forgot the name.</p>

<p>I've noticed that you play only old games, isn't it a bit boring? :))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My reply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, it's <a href="https://github.com/dreamlayers/em-dosbox/">DOSBox ported to javascript</a> and running in a browser.</p>

<p>Regarding old games - no, I play new games sometimes, too: I played Fallout 3 soon after it was released - I completed it in 3 days - it was quite happy time in my life.
But old games, on contrary, I can't complete that fast.</p>

<p>And now I'm waiting for GTA V to be released on PC, since I enjoyed playing GTA 2 and 3.
I also will need to buy a new PC for that, since last time I upgraded it just enough to play Morrowind. :-)</p>
