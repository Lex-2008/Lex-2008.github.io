<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Client:</p>

<p>Our staff has competed the 18 months of work on time and on budget. We have gone through every line of code in every program in every system. We have analyzed all databases, all data files, including backups and historic archives, and modified all data to reflect the change. We are proud to report that we have completed the "Y-to-K" date change mission, and have not implemented all changes to all programs and all data to reflect your new date standards as follows:</p>

<p>Januark, Februark, March, April, Mak, June, Julk, August, September, October, November and December</p>

<p>As well as:</p>

<p>Sundak, Mondak, Tuesdak, Wednesdak. Thursdak, Fridak, and Saturdak</p>

<p>I trust that this is satisfactory, because to be honest, none of this Y to K problem has made any sense to us. But I understand it is a global problem, and our entire team including our French immersion teacher are standing by and are glad to help in any way possible.</p>

<p>By the way, we never did understand what the year 2000 has to do with the Y-to-K. Speaking of which, what do you think we ought to do next year when the two-digit years rolls from 99 to 00?</p>

<p>We'll wait for kour direction,</p>

<p>Have a good dak!</p>

<p>Above page attributes it to Angela Armstrong.
Trying to find origins of this joke, it quickly became obvious that in its current form it's result of work of many people - not just one text that is copypasted around, but everyone refines it slightly in the process.
Best results (less noise) I got when searching the web for word "Wednesdak".</p>

<p>Among webpages with dates, earliest I could find was
