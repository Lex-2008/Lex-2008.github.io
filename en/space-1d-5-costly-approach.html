			<p class="intro">Changes in physics</p>
			<p>A new type of component (and cargo) added: Defense Grid (which uses Defense Ammo).
Engines and fuel are now used for different purpose: now they are used for approach.</p>

<p>But first, defense: mathematcis got simpler: one defense grid destroys one incoming rocket.
So if your ship has more defense grids than opponent ship has guns - you won't lose any component.
Which is easier to estimate by AI, but makes the game a bit less <em>fun</em>.</p>

<p>Moreover, approach and avoid commands cost some fuel - so now AI attacks less frequently, and player tends to be more conservative, too.
You're less likely to "approach aggressively" a smaller empty ship just for fun.</p>

<p>Space docks now accept only fuel,
and a new random encounter added - a space dump - which converts any component to Cargo Bay (and destroys cargo bay),
and any cargo - to fuel.</p>

<p>This way it's much easirt to build "a spaceship of your dreams", which raises a question: <em>now what</em>?
Probably, we should start <em>colonising</em> some asteroids, but that gets out of "1d-space" idea... into 2d, at least :)
Note to self: it's possible to do with <a href="http://devmag.org.za/2009/05/03/poisson-disk-sampling/">Poisson disk sampling</a> or <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/#trees">Perlin/Simplex noise</a>.
Second approach is heavier on calculations, but doesn't require storing position of each point in savegames.</p>

<p>Due to above changes, currently there is no trading and ability to use engines to avoid rockets - these features are likely to return in future updates.</p>
